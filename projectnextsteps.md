# Project Next Steps

## 1. Test Current API Endpoints
- Use a tool like Postman or curl to test `/generate-response` and `/score-call` endpoints.
- Example request for `/score-call`:
  ```json
  {
    "user_input": "Hi, I'm calling to talk about our new product...",
    "history": "...full conversation so far...",
    "persona": "Skeptical CTO at a SaaS company",
    "offer": "AI-powered sales training platform"
  }
  ```
- Verify that you receive a valid score and feedback in the response.

## 2. Integrate Audio Transcription (AssemblyAI)
- Set up AssemblyAI API key and Python SDK.
- Add a backend endpoint to accept audio files, send them to AssemblyAI, and return the transcript.
- Use the transcript as `user_input` for the `/generate-response` and `/score-call` endpoints.

## 3. (Optional) Text-to-Speech (TTS) for AI Responses
- If AssemblyAI or another service supports TTS, add an endpoint to convert AI responses to audio.
- If not, display the AI response as text in the frontend.

## 4. Frontend Integration
- Build a simple frontend to:
  - Record user audio and send to backend for transcription.
  - Display AI's text response (and optionally play TTS audio).
  - Show call score and feedback after the session.

## 5. Analytics and Data Tracking
- Store call transcripts, scores, and feedback for each session.
- Build endpoints to retrieve analytics for users/teams.

## 6. Customization and Sharing
- Allow users to create and save custom personas and offers.
- Enable sharing of AI prospects/scenarios with team members.

## 7. Documentation and Polish
- Write clear API documentation.
- Add error handling and validation.
- Prepare for deployment (Docker, cloud, etc.).
